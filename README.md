# Client-Server-Communication-using-Sockets
A C-based multi-server file management system using sockets. Client interacts only with S1, which stores `.c` files locally and routes `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.zip` files to S2, S3, and S4. Supports upload, download, remove, and tarball fetch commands through a simple CLI.
